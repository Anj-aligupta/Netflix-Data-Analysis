# Netflix-Data-Analysis
# 📊 Netflix Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my first Data Analysis project using Python and Pandas. This project explores and analyzes the Netflix dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to the platform’s content, country contributions, release trends, and content type distribution.

---
## 🧠 Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix content and answer key questions like:

- What type of content is most common: Movies or TV Shows?
- Which countries produce the most Netflix content?
- How has content grown over the years?
- What are the popular genres and trends?

## 📌 Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, fixed date formats.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Created new features like `year_added` and `month_added`.
3. **Data Visualization** – Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate clear insights.
4. **Insights Generation** – Identified trends and presented findings.
